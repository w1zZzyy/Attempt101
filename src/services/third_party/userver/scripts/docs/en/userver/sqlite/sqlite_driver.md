## SQLite Driver

**Quality:** @ref QUALITY_TIERS "Silver Tier".

üêô **userver** provides access to SQLite databases servers via
components::SQLite. The uSQLite driver is asynchronous, and with it one can
write queries like this: [Sample SQLite usage](https://github.com/userver-framework/userver/tree/develop/samples/sqlite_service)

No macros, no meta-structs, no boilerplate, just your types used directly.

### Features
- Asynchronous API based on userver coroutines;
- Automatic connection pooling with smart routing;
- Prepared statements with variadic-template parameter binding;
- Full transaction & savepoint support (RAII);
- Read-only cursors;
- Compile-time-safe composite bindings, runtime-checked primitives;
- Straightforward result extraction into C++ types;
- Bi-directional mapping between C++ and native SQLite types;
- Built-in support for userver types: Decimal64, JSON, boost::uuid;
- Nullable wrappers for all types via std::optional<T>;
- Seamless integration with userver infrastructure: configuration, logging, metrics, etc.
