    When `false`, disables deadline propagation in the service. This includes:

    - reading the task-inherited deadline from HTTP headers and gRPC metadata;
    - interrupting operations when deadline expires;
    - propagating the deadline to downstream services and databases.

    Deadline propagation can also be disabled in the static config of:
    - components::Server (disables the HTTP handler part).

    Deadline propagation is disabled if disabled statically OR dynamically.
